# Welcome
Yay, you made it! ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the documentation for UCL's brand new open API. Each service is listed below with examples in three different programming languages (Shell script using cURL, Python and JavaScript) to help you get going as quickly as possible.

The API will be made up of several services, each of which will be separately versioned and explained. Every service will be documented here with important information, tips and examples.

## Get Your API Key
Before you can use the API you should head to the [API Dashboard](https://uclapi.com/dashboard) and sign up using your UCL user account. Once logged into the dashboard simply name your app and you'll be given a key that you can use to access all the services. Simples!

# Version Information

Each service has a header named `uclapi-servicenamehere-version` which you can add to your requests, where `servicenamehere` is the endpoint name for the service you are using. For example, for the Room Bookings service you would set the `uclapi-roombookings-version` header.

```shell
curl -H "uclapi-roombookings-version: 1" https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb
```

```python
import requests

params = {
  "token": "uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb"
}
headers = {
  "uclapi-roombookings-version": "1"
}
r = requests.get("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms", params=params, headers=headers)
print(r.json())
```

```javascript
var myHeaders = new Headers();
myHeaders.append("uclapi-roombookings-version", "1");
var initData = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: myHeaders,
  mode: 'cors',
  cache: 'default'
};
fetch("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb", initData)
.then((response) => {
  return response.json()
})
.then((json) => {
  console.log(json);
  })
```

<aside class="warning">
  <strong>Really Important Warning</strong>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>By default, every UCL API request gets sent to the <strong>latest version</strong> of the service you requested.</li>
    <li>This is okay for test purposes.</li>
    <li>If you are deploying into production you must follow the versioning instructions to ensure you are not affected by breaking changes.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

On the right hand side you'll see a code sample with the version data added. We are specifying that version `1` of the `roombookings` service should be used for the request URL `https://uclapi.com/roombookings/rooms?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb`. You should amend the example accordingly for the service and API version you are using.

# Room Bookings

The base url is `https://uclapi.com/roombookings/`

Version Header | Latest Version
-------------- | --------------
`uclapi-roombookings-version` | `1`

## Get Rooms

### Paginated Request
**Endpoint:** `https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings`

Paginated requests also go to the `/bookings` endpoint but, unlike the regular requests, only the `token` and `page_token` should be supplied. All other filters are "remembered" from the initiating regular request.

The API "remembers" how many requests you've made, so to move through the pages you can keep making the same request (with the same `token` and `page_token`) until the response's `next_page_exists` field is `false`.

**Allowed request type:** `GET`

#### Query Parameters

```shell
curl https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&page_token=6hb14hXjRV
```

```python
import requests

params = {
  "token": "uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb",
  "page_token": "6hb14hXjRV"
}

r = requests.get("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings", params=params)
print(r.json())
```

```javascript
fetch("https://uclapi.com/roombookings/bookings?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&page_token=6hb14hXjRV")
.then((response) => {
  return response.json()
})
.then((json) => {
  console.log(json);
  })
```

Parameter | Example | Required | Description
--------- | ---------- | ----------- | -----------
`token` | `uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb` | Required | Authentication token
`page_token` | `6hb14hXjRV` | Required | Page token received in initial `/bookings` request. The page token does not change as you paginate through the results.

#### Response

```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "page_token": "wmCUiJgItq",
    "next_page_exists": true,
    "bookings": [
      {
        "roomname": "Christopher Ingold Building XLG2 Auditorium",
        "slotid": 733044,
        "siteid": "067",
        "start_time": "2017-03-20T13:00:00+00:00",
        "roomid": "XLG2",
        "weeknumber": 30,
        "description": "",
        "end_time": "2017-03-20T14:00:00+00:00",
        "phone": "",
        "contact": "Dr Mark Roberts"
      },
      ...
    ]
}
```

The response to a paginated request is identical to that of a regular request, except that no `count` field is provided.
