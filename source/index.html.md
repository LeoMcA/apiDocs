#Get Bookings for a Room

### `/bookings`

This endpoint shows the results to a bookings or space availability query.

The `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` parameters **must** be given in ISO 8601 format. No other formats are accepted. An example of this format is `2017-02-18T13:32:29+00:00`.

If `start_datetime` or `end_datetime` is given, `startdate` will be ignored. If `startdate` is used, it will return all bookings for that specific day with all the other given filters applied.

The API doesn't return all bookings at once, but instead uses *pagination* which can split results across multiple pages. You can specify the maximum number of results per page by supplying the `results_per_page` parameter. If you do not specify `results_per_page`, it will be set to `20` by default. The maximum accepted value is `100`.

An example of a query is given below:

`url = "https://uclapi.com/api/bookings?contact=Wilhelm&results_per_page=5&token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb"`

This url has 3 parameters, `contact`, `token` and `results_per_page`.

`r = requests.get(url)`

Making this request will get us the data shown below:

`{
    "ok": true,
    "bookings": {
        "page_token": "TmJlhCJSUR",
        "bookings": [
            {
                "room": "Darwin Building B05",
                "contact": "Wilhelm Klopp - UCLU Tech Society",
                "start_time": "2016-12-07T00:00::00",
                "end_time": "2016-12-07T00:00::00",
                "description": "Meeting",
                "roomid": "B05A",
                "siteid": "044",
                "slotid": 1038241,
                "weeknumber": 15,
                "phone": ""
            },
            ...
        ],
        "count": 155,
        "next_page_exists": true
    }
}`

Value of the `ok` field tells if the request was successful.

Inside `bookings` we have every booking that fits the relevant filters, along with more information. The first 'page' will contain a `count` field which indicates the total number of results which fit your request. If there are more 'pages' to follow, the boolean field, `next_page_exists`, will be set to True.

To get the other pages in subsequent requests, you only have to pass the `page_token` in another request to the the same URL- no other parameters are required. Then you can make a request to the same endpoint with just the `page_token` and authentication token in `token`.

So the next request url will be:

`url = "https://uclapi.com/api/bookings?token=uclapi-5d58c3c4e6bf9c-c2910ad3b6e054-7ef60f44f1c14f-a05147bfd17fdb&page_token=TmJlhCJSUR"`

The server will keep track of how many pages you have received, and how many you are yet to go through. If `page_token` is given in your request, any other parameter will be ignored. You make requests until the `next_page_exists` is `false`.
