#Get Bookings for a Room

### `/bookings`

This endpoint shows the bookings for a room.

`start_datetime` and `end_datetime` should be given in ISO8601 format. No other formats are accepted.

If `start_datetime` or `end_datetime` is given, `startdate` will be ignored. If `startdate` is used, it will return all bookings for that specific day with all the other given filters applied

The API doesn't return all bookings at once. It uses something called pagination. If there are a lot of results, we split them up across different pages.
The results are paginated. You can specify the maximum number of results per page by supplying the `results_per_page` parameter. The maximum value we'll except for this is `100`. If this is not specified with the request, it will be set to 20 by default. The first page will have a `count` field which is the total number of results for the request made. If there are more pages, `next_page_exists` will be set to True. For subsequent requests, you only have to pass the `page_token`, no other parameters are required. Server will keep track of the pages you have been through and how many results you need to go through. If `page_token` is given every other parameters will be ignored.
